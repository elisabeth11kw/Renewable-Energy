# Predict the Growth of Wind and Solar energy production.
•	Has wind and solar energy production increased in the past 10 years? 
•	Which states renewable energy growth rates are increasing at a higher rate?
•	What are common words used in articles from the https://www.greenpeace.org/ website?

# Data Science tasks
•	Find current growth areas in renewable energy in the United States.
•	Find areas where there is potential for renewable energy growth in the United States.
•	Analyze were based on the population the greatest benefits for new renewable energy exist.
Analyze text in articles to find the common theme in renewable energy Data.
The current data source that I have is more than 33k records containing data from 50 states and 2 territories with data from 2011 to 2019.  I will do a web scrape on twitter to see and comments on renewable energy.  The data contains summary data with 87 different columns which I will summarize or remove columns if they do not add value.
